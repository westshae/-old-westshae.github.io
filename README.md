# A quick introduction
This website is a small project of mine so I can begin to have an online presence with my development

## How to run
* Ensure all dependancies have been included, using "npm install"
* To run a dev build to see the website on your own network, run the command "npm start"
* To push this project to your github pages server, you can use "npm run deploy"


## Purposes of my different pages
* My homepage is currently made to be a small introduction to myself, and I plan to include summaries about things such as my skills, technologies, projects etc.
* My portfolio page is a quick way to see my projects, and I plan to include a system to show which projects I believe are my best. This page includes links to my github repos, a list of the technologies I used, plus a small brief on what the project does.
* My contact page will contain all the ways to contact me, plus the most effective ways to contact me.
